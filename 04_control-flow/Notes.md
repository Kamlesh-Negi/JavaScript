 JavaScript operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. They can be categorized into several types based on their functionality. Here are the main types of operators in JavaScript:

 ### 1. Arithmetic Operators

 These operators perform basic mathematical operations.

   * Addition (+): Adds two operands.

            let a = 5;
            let b = 3;
            console.log(a + b); // 8

   * Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.

          console.log(a - b); // 2

   * Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.

          console.log(a * b); // 15

   * Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second.

          console.log(a / b); // 1.6666666666666667

   * Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division.

          console.log(a % b); // 2

   * Exponentiation (**): Raises the first operand to the power of the second.

          console.log(a ** b); // 125

   * Increment (++): Increases an integer value by one.

          a++;
          console.log(a); // 6

   * Decrement (--): Decreases an integer value by one.

          b--;
          console.log(b); // 2
